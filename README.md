# Starter for Typescript/EsNext/Mocha-Chai
 
This is a minimal starter typescript project using ES modules, with mocha/chai tests. It also supports running these tests via  wallaby.js.

Run tests either manually with 
`npm run test`
or from wallabyjs, eg by choosing `Wallaby.js | start` from the vscode palette menu.
